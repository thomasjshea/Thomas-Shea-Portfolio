                <p class="bio">My Name is Thomas Shea. I grew up in Rome, Georgia and attended Darlington School. I
                    graduated from Auburn University in 2016 with a degree in Finance. I currently reside in Birmingham,
                    Alabama where I have lived since 2019.
                    I enjoy hanging out with my wife and four dogs and playing golf and video games in my free time. I
                    am a huge fan of all Auburn Tigers sports, the Atlanta Braves, and the Green Bay Packers.
                </p>
                <p class="bio">My professional background is in Consumer and Small Business Finance. I have worked the
                    past several years in management with finance companies and banks. My inspiration to get into Coding
                    and Web Design are the endless
                    opportunities available in the field and my passion for designing and creating things, as well as my
                    interest in computers.
