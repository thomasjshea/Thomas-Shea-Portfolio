                    <p>My Name is Thomas Shea. I grew up in Rome, Georgia and attended Darlington School. I
                        graduated from Auburn University in 2016 with a degree in Finance. I currently reside in
                        Birmingham,
                        Alabama where I have lived since 2019.
                        I enjoy hanging out with my wife and four dogs and playing golf and video games in my free time.
                        I
                        am a huge fan of the Auburn Tigers, the Atlanta Braves, and the Green Bay Packers.
                    </p>
                    <p>My professional background is in Consumer and Small Business Finance. I have worked the
                        past several years in management with finance companies and banks. My inspiration to get into
                        Coding
                        and Web Design are the endless
                        opportunities available in the field and my passion for designing and creating things, as well
                        as my
                        interest in computers.
                    </p>
